## Extra credits

LuCrateCC utilizes the "max96at"'s GitHub Repository Downloader as its core component.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find an official GitHub repository for this project, nor a license to include. 
However, I discovered the package mentioned in this [forum post](https://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/4072-github-repository-downloader/).

Feel free to explore the forum post for more information and updates on the GitHub Repository Downloader.
LuCrateCC uses version 1.1 of GitHub Repository Downloader, but is modified to match the needs.
